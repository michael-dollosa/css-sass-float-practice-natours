# css-sass-float-practice-natours

This is a practice website for css-sass utilizing float as the layout element.

You may fork this repo and use it as a practice set. Just be sure to put credits to the original designer (written on the footer).
Please take note that the final website based on the original course is slightly different. I have made some modification in the design.
